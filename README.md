# omarchy-asus

A tabbed ASUS laptop control panel for the [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) bar,
built on [`asusctl`](https://asus-linux.org/). Power profiles, keyboard RGB,
editable fan curves, and firmware limits — organized like
[G-Helper](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper), scoped to what your specific
model actually supports.

## Why

The stock single-scroll ASUS panel dumps every `asusctl` feature into one
column regardless of whether your laptop supports it — wattage sliders with
no context, keyboard RGB effects that silently no-op on unsupported hardware,
a fan curve toggle for the master enable that never appears in the UI. This
plugin detects what your specific model reports supporting and only shows
that.

## Features

- **Main** — power profile (Quiet/Balanced/Performance), battery charge limit
  (when supported).
- **RGB** — keyboard lighting, filtered to the aura effects your laptop
  actually reports (`asusctl info --show-supported`), not a fixed list of
  twelve.
- **Fan** — a master "Custom Fan Curves" switch (previously missing from the
  UI, causing per-fan toggles to silently no-op), draggable fan curve editor
  per fan (CPU/GPU, plus Mid on laptops with a third fan), and a one-click
  reset always visible next to each curve.
- **Advanced** — firmware limits (PL1/PL2, GPU boost/temp target, GPU MUX,
  dGPU disable, panel overdrive), each shown only if `asusctl armoury list`
  reports your laptop actually exposes it.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# From AUR
yay -S asusctl

# Or from the OGC Arch repo — see https://asus-linux.org for setup
sudo pacman -S asusctl

sudo systemctl enable --now asusd.service
```

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/moneytosms/omarchy-asus.git --enable
```

Or clone manually into `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.moneytosms.asus`
and enable it via the Omarchy plugin menu.

## Configuration

`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`, under the plugin's settings:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `showBatteryLimit` | boolean | `true` | Show the battery charge limit section on Main |
| `refreshIntervalSec` | integer | `10` | Poll interval while the panel is open (5–60s) |

## Compatibility

Works with any laptop `asusctl` supports (ROG, TUF, ProArt, Zenbook). Every
section — RGB effects, fan curves, individual firmware attributes — is gated
on what `asusctl` reports for your specific model; unsupported controls don't
appear rather than sitting there doing nothing.

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Verify the plugin is detected
omarchy plugin validate ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.moneytosms.asus

# Check asusd is running
systemctl status asusd

# Check what your model supports
asusctl info --show-supported
asusctl armoury list
```
